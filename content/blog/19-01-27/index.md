I think the word was progress\
but I know it's going to haunt us\
We got nice things. I mean, __can__ we get\
nice things?\
And while we smile for the future as we\
turn shit into gold,\
we forget that gold can't make gold\
and shit can't make gold and real lives are\
turned to shit as their shit gets torn down\
and turned to someone else's gold\
I'm like "do I want to wait to see if it gets better?"\
I'm like "do I want to see it if it doesn't?"\
I think the word was progress\
but I know it's going to haunt us\
Pushing humans like they're rats pushing pushing\
til a human is a rat and you are shocked\
when that rat kicks the door down of the\
house it used to live while the new owner was\
inside.\
It's like "how can we let this happen?"\
It's like "how can I not live in fear while it does?"
