Last weekend I met with the person I was consulting with to do the writing. For all intents and purposes, he was a co-creator. I've known him since college and both he and I have gotten along but we are different people.

I've kept in touch with him over the past decade mostly through Steam. Occasionally a game we were playing overlapped and we played it together for a couple months. It was like that, on and off, since about 2010. Last year, I reached out to him to discuss this show because I know he had spent some time in LA, working on some writing of his own, trying to break it big. He was happy and interested in working and quite honestly, he has been one of the best partners for this project.

We have collaborated over the past year through phone calls and [RealtimeBoard](https://realtimeboard.com/). It's been very business for the most part. But through this time, we had only been in touch via technology. And technology lies.

Spending time with him, in person, was a flash of reality.

In college, I liked him but as I said, we are different people. I interpreted some of his actions in college as immature and offensive. I assumed that he had dropped some of those qualities, especially since we had stayed in communication for all these years and these grating qualities never came out.

But after spending time with him over the weekend, I realized it was still there. He's just as immature and offensive as he was back then. In college, I could pass it off as annoying, but now that I am moving forward with a project that already has so much stacked against me, he is a liability.

There are risks I can take and there are risks I should mitigate. He is something that should be mitigated. I can't willfully do business with someone who says tone-deaf offensive things as if they are funny.

It's a terrible feeling. But I have to do this. I just need to move on.

Thank him for his effort and time, but tell him honestly that it just won't work out between us.

Sorry, Chase.
