Twelve years.

In two months I will have been a cop for twelve years. But I've always been a cop.

Since I was a kid, I'd make police issued Beretta 9mm replicas out of clay while the other kids were making shitty cats or chocolate chip cookies. Some people were born to be cops because they knew the other side so well that becoming an officer of the law seemed like it was the only legitimate way for them to use their skills to make money. I wasn't one of those people.

My upbringing wasn't luxurious but it was comfortable. My dad was a software salesman who was so successful that my mom never had to work. We had a pretty big house in the suburbs. I could have been a doctor or a lawyer if I wanted to but I had always loved the idea of rank and respect. A clear cut career trajectory, with your next position as clear as a baseball card in your hand. And wearing a gun to work, all the time, even to lunch. Knowing deep down that behind every politician's initiative, every doctor's prescription, every teacher's promise that math is power is the unspoken understanding that I am there.

All this dream of prosperity and progress would be swallowed by chaos over night without me.
