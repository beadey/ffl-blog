The point of this blog is to chronicle two people with no experience writing for TV, writing for TV. And not only that but writing a comedy. It's a big undertaking but I think we have a shot.

The show is Future Football League. The premise is:

> In 2081, competing city-states governed by football franchises battle for world power, while four referees try to enforce the rules, solve the occasional mystery and find new ways to get paid obscene amounts of money.ï»¿

It's been nearly a decade since I first conceived of Future Football League and I'm sad it's taken me so long to finally pull the trigger. With immense help from Chase, this past year has been the most effective thus far.

This isn't the beginning but it seems that way here.
