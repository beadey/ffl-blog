It's not that life is hard or unfair - it's just that life is life. Life is an empty house. It's the one left to rot after the police kick in the door and bust up the drug dealers holding up shop next door. You can look at that house and see an eyesore, a manifestation of the street you live on. Or you can see potential.

It's all just overgrown weeds tangled up with used condoms, bent needles and Doritos bags. You look at it and wonder if it's worth building anything on, or just let it be. If you build on it, you can throw away the trash and cut down the weeds, but that won't remove the source. So you just walk by it, every day and try not to think of the filth.

If the sun is up and the weather is just right, that lot can look beautiful. But most of the time it is exactly what it is - an overgrown lot with a shell of a house where street hoes go to fuck and get high.
