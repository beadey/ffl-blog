I'm walking backwards my eyes are so far\
over my shoulder between lights\
Every night, every night I fool myself into\
thinking I'm alright to walk alone a half\
a mile\
A while ago or maybe it was this year some\
dude got shot and if you secretly pump your\
fist when you find out it was over drugs\
this one was not\
He was just shot - even after he handed over\
his money - even after he did what they wanted\
I'm not bound by the sun\
But I keep my fucking guns in my sleeves\
So throw your hands in the air if\
you're white and you're afraid\
So throw your hands in the air if\
you're black and you're afraid\
My street's got nice houses - I wonder\
how many have been robbed?\
It's a good thing\
my place looks shitty otherwise I might be in that club\
So shitty I'm embarrassed to even have my friends over - so\
I walk to meet them.\
I'm not bound by the sun\
But I keep my fucking guns in my sleeves
